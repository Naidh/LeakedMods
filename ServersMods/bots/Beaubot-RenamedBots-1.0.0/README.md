# EmuTarkov -- Renamed Bots

This mod provides random English names to replace the 1,786 random Russian names for bots in EmuTarkov.
Currently bot modding is not implemented, so you will need to copy this mod directly 
into the DB/bots folders. The names list is compiled from EFT Twitch Streamers and the Tarkov Leaderboards.

I personally only use these names to replace the USEC/BEAR PMC names, but it should work
if you wanted to use these in place of the Russian Scav names as well.
